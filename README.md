Q1) Mention the working of Internet Website in Terms of Front-end & Back-end Divisions.

Ans1) The front-end and back-end divisions collaborate to create a fully functional and user-friendly website.   
Front-end: The front-end refers to the client side of a website that users interact with directly. It involves the presentation layer and user interface (UI) design. The technologies and languages commonly used for front-end development include HTML (Hypertext Markup Language), CSS (Cascading Style Sheets), and JavaScript. The front-end division focuses on creating an appealing and user-friendly interface. It involves designing and structuring web pages, implementing layouts, styling elements, handling user interactions, and incorporating visual components like images, videos, and animations. Front-end developers ensure that the website is visually engaging and responsive.

Back-end: The back-end, also known as the server-side, deals with server configuration, database management, business logic implementation, and server-side scripting. It includes tasks like handling user authentication, managing data storage and retrieval, and processing form submissions. Back-end development involves using programming languages such as Python, Ruby, PHP, Java, or Node.js, along with frameworks and libraries. It comprises the server, database, and application logic. Back-end developers ensure the smooth functioning of the website's functionality and interaction with databases and external services.

Q2) What are tags in HTML? Explain each category of tag with an Example.

Ans2) In HTML, tags are used to define the structure and elements of a web page. Tags are enclosed in angle brackets ("<>" and "</>") and provide instructions to the browser on how to display the content. Some tags are empty like <img> tag which has only an opening bracket.

1. Heading Tags (h1, h2, h3, etc.):
Heading tags define different levels of headings on a web page. The "h1" tag represents the highest level, while "h2" represents the second highest, and so on. These tags help organize and structure the content of the page. Example:

<h1>This is a Heading</h1>
<h2>This is a Subheading</h2>
2. Paragraph Tags (p):
The paragraph tag is used to define a paragraph of text on a web page. It represents a block-level element and adds spacing before and after the content within the tag. Example:
<p>This is a paragraph of text.</p>
3. Link Tags (a):
The link tag is used to create hyperlinks on a web page. It allows users to navigate to other pages, files, or locations. The "href" attribute specifies the destination URL. Example:
<a href="https://www.google.com">Visit Google Website</a>
4. Image Tags (img):
The image tag is used to embed images in a web page. The "src" attribute specifies the path or URL of the image file, and the "alt" attribute provides alternative text that describes the image. Example:
<img src="image.jpg" alt="Description of the image">
5. List Tags (ul, ol, li):
List tags are used to create ordered and unordered lists on a web page. The "ul" tag represents an unordered list, the "ol" tag represents an ordered list, and the "li" tag defines individual list items within the list. Example:
<ul>
  <li>List item 1</li>
  <li>List item 2</li>
  <li>List item 3</li>
</ul>
6. Table Tags (table, tr, td,th,thead,tbody,tfoot):
Table tags are used to create structured tabular data on a web page. The "table" tag represents the entire table, the "tr" tag defines a row within the table, and the "td" tag defines individual cells within each row. Example:
<table>
  <tr>
    <th>Row 1, Cell 1</th>
    <td>Row 1, Cell 2</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Row 2, Cell 1</td>
    <td>Row 2, Cell 2</td>
  </tr>
</table>
7. Form Tags (form, input, select, button):
Form tags are used to create interactive forms on a web page, allowing users to input and submit data. The "form" tag represents the entire form, the "input" tag is used for various input fields like text, checkboxes, radio buttons, etc., the "select" tag creates a dropdown menu, and the "button" tag creates buttons. Example:
<form>
  <label for="name">Name:</label>
  <input type="text" id="name" name="name">

  <label for="email">Email:</label>
  <input type="email" id="email" name="email">

  <label for="country">Country:</label>
  <select id="country" name="country">
    <option value="usa">USA</option>
    <option value="uk">UK</option>
    <option value="india">India</option>
  </select>

  <button type="submit">Submit</button>
</form>
8. Header Tags (header, nav, main, footer):
Header tags are used to define different sections of a web page's layout. The "header" tag represents the introductory section or the top part of a page, the "nav" tag is used for navigation menus, the "main" tag defines the main content area, and the "footer" tag represents the footer section at the bottom of the page. Example:
<header>
  <h1>Website Title</h1>
</header>

<nav>
  <ul>
    <li><a href="#">Home</a></li>
    <li><a href="#">About</a></li>
    <li><a href="#">Contact</a></li>
  </ul>
</nav>

<main>
  <h2>Welcome to the website!</h2>
  <p>This is the main content area.</p>
</main>

<footer>
  <p>&copy; 2023 Website Name. All rights reserved.</p>
</footer>
9. Media Tags (audio, video, iframe):
Media tags allow the inclusion of various types of media on a web page. The "audio" tag is used for embedding audio files, the "video" tag is used for embedding video files, and the "iframe" tag is used for embedding external content, such as maps or other web pages. Example:
<audio src="audio.mp3" controls></audio>

<video src="video.mp4" controls></video>

<iframe src="https://www.google.com/maps/embed?pb=!1m18!1m12!1m3!1d...</iframe>


Q3) Explain the working Procedure of Virtual DOM.

Ans3) Virtual DOM (VDOM) is a concept used in web development frameworks like React to improve performance and efficiency when updating the user interface. The working procedure of the Virtual DOM is:

1. Initial Rendering:
When an application is first loaded or initialized, the initial rendering of the user interface takes place. The framework builds a representation of the UI known as the Virtual DOM tree, which is a lightweight copy of the actual DOM.

2. Virtual DOM Tree Manipulation:
Developers work with components and their associated virtual DOM representations. They define the structure and behavior of these components using declarative syntax. Any changes made to the components are reflected in the virtual DOM tree.

3. Reconciliation:
When a change occurs in the application state or props of a component, a process called reconciliation takes place. React compares the new virtual DOM tree with the previous one to identify the differences or updates that need to be made in the actual DOM.

4. Diffing Algorithm:
React uses a diffing algorithm to efficiently determine the minimal set of changes needed to update the real DOM. It compares the new virtual DOM tree with the previous one, looking for differences in component structure, content, or properties.

5. Update of Actual DOM:
After the diffing algorithm identifies the necessary changes, it applies the updates to the actual DOM. Only the specific parts of the DOM that require modification are updated, rather than re-rendering the entire page.

6. Efficient Rendering:
By using the Virtual DOM and the diffing algorithm, React optimizes the rendering process. It reduces the number of actual DOM manipulations required, resulting in better performance and a smoother user experience.

7. Repeating the Process:
As the application continues to update and change over time, the Virtual DOM process is repeated whenever there are updates to the components or application state. This allows for efficient and optimized rendering, minimizing the impact on performance.

The Virtual DOM provides a layer of abstraction between the actual DOM and the application's components. It allows developers to work with a lightweight representation of the UI, improving performance by reducing unnecessary updates to the real DOM.

Q4) Mention some Differences between MySQL and No SQL.

Ans4) MySQL is a relational database management system and NoSQL is a non-relational database management system.
They differ as:

1. Data Model:
MySQL- MySQL follows a structured and predefined schema based on tables, rows, and columns. It uses SQL (Structured Query Language) for defining and manipulating data.
NoSQL- NoSQL databases do not rely on a fixed schema. They use flexible data models like key-value pairs, documents, and columnar, or graph structures.

2. Data Consistency:
MySQL- MySQL ensures strong data consistency, where data is reliably and immediately updated across the database.
NoSQL- NoSQL databases often prioritize high availability and scalability over strong consistency. They may offer eventual consistency, where data updates are propagated asynchronously, leading to temporary inconsistencies.

3. Data Relationships:
MySQL- MySQL supports complex relationships between tables through the use of foreign keys, enforcing referential integrity.
NoSQL- NoSQL databases generally do not enforce strong relationships between data. Data can be stored denormalized, allowing for faster querying and retrieval.

4. Use Cases:
MySQL- MySQL is widely used for traditional relational database scenarios, such as e-commerce platforms, content management systems, and financial applications that require structured and consistent data.
NoSQL- NoSQL databases are often used for handling large amounts of unstructured or semi-structured data, real-time analytics, content caching, and scenarios where high scalability and flexibility are crucial.

5. ACID Compliance:
MySQL- MySQL follows the ACID (Atomicity, Consistency, Isolation, Durability) principles, ensuring strict data consistency and transactional integrity. It provides transaction support, allowing multiple operations to be grouped together and either committed or rolled back as a unit.
NoSQL- NoSQL databases often prioritize high availability and scalability over strict ACID compliance. They follow the CAP theoram (Consistency, Availability, and Partition Tolerance) which states that it is impossible to guarantee all three properties in a distributed system with data replication.

Q5) Explain any one DBMS Technology in your own words.

Ans5) One popular DBMS technology is **MySQL**. MySQL is an open-source relational database management system that allows users to store, manage, and retrieve structured data efficiently. MySQL follows the client-server architecture, where multiple client applications can connect to a central MySQL server to perform database operations. It uses Structured Query Language (SQL) as the standard language for interacting with the database.
Features of MySQL-

1. Data Organization: MySQL stores data in tables, which consist of rows and columns. Tables define the structure and relationships of data using primary keys, foreign keys, and indexes.

2. SQL Language Support: It allows users to perform operations such as selecting, inserting, updating, and deleting data, as well as joining tables and executing complex queries.

3. Data Integrity and Security: MySQL ensures data integrity through referential integrity using foreign keys. It also provides user authentication, access control, and encryption mechanisms to protect the data.

4. Scalability: MySQL supports various techniques for improving performance and scalability, such as replication, sharding, and caching.

5. Cross-Platform Compatibility: MySQL is cross-platform and can run on various operating systems, including Windows, macOS, Linux, and UNIX. It is widely supported by different programming languages and frameworks.

MySQL is used in a wide range of applications, including web development, content management systems, e-commerce platforms, data analytics, and more.
